About me
======
I started my academic journey in business, but over time I became more interested in how technology actually works and how it shapes people’s experiences. This curiosity led me to shift from business to informatics, and now my focus lies in building and understanding interactive systems that connect technical development with human needs.

I enjoy learning new technologies and experimenting with them to create practical, human-centered applications. Through my studies and projects, I’ve worked on AI-driven systems, voice interaction tools, and accessibility-focused web applications. Each of these experiences has deepened my belief that technology should be understandable, inclusive, and beneficial to real people—not just efficient or data-driven.

Having studied and worked in international environments, I’ve learned to adapt quickly and collaborate across cultures and disciplines. I see this adaptability as one of my core strengths—it allows me to bridge perspectives between design, technology, and users from diverse backgrounds.



Research Interests
======
My research focuses on how AI and interactive technologies can be used to support people in meaningful and practical ways. I’m interested in the whole process—from understanding user needs and designing intuitive interfaces to developing intelligent systems that can make a real difference in everyday life.

So far, my projects have explored topics such as AI-driven voice interaction for propaganda awareness, focus tracking for programmers, and accessibility improvements for web users. These experiences have strengthened my interest in combining technical development with empathy and design thinking.

I’m open to diverse ideas and enjoy exploring new ways technology can help people think, learn, and live better. What matters most to me is creating systems that are not only functional but also thoughtful and human-centered. I genuinely enjoy engaging with users, and seeing them satisfied—or hearing their feedback—gives me a real sense of fulfillment and motivation to keep improving what I build.
